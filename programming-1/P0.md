# Programming 1 Lab P0
## Oct 9, 2025

## Preparation
### Sec 2.1
* Installed and set up Vim as my editor, which I will be primarily using.
* Using Bash as my shell on a Fedora Linux environment.
* Also installed all the required Python extensions as well as the Pycharms IDE, connected to my Uni email for the education edition.

### Sec 2.3

Formula       | Meaning                                 | `x = 3` | `x = 4` | `x = 11`
--------------|-----------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------
x==4          | x is equivalent to 4                    | False   | True    | False
x>4           | x is larger than 4                      | False   | False   | True
x>=4          | x is larger than or equivalent to 4.    | False   | True    | True
x!=4          | x is not equal to 4.                    | True    | False   | True
x>2 and x < 8 | x is bigger than 2, but smaller than 8. | True    | True    | False
x>8 or x < 2  | x is bigger than 8 or less than 2.      | False   | False   | True

### Sec 2.4
**Running from Python REPL**
* In the terminal, run `python3` to open the Python REPL.
* Code can now be entered in the interactive shell.

**Running Jupyter Notebook**
* Run `jupyter notebook` in the terminal.
* This will start a server and open Firefox to the notebook.

**Running Python Scripts**
* In the terminal navigate to the directory containing the script.
* Run `python3 <filename>` to run the program.

## Lab Work
### Sec 3.2.2
* Each cell is run individually of each other, but can make use of things defined in previous cells. For example, if the first cell contains the line `x: int = 4`, then the value of `x` can be used in subsequent cells.
* Updating 1 cell and re-running it will *not* automatically update the outputs of other cells. In the example above, if the value of `x` is changed to `5`, all cells dependant on `x` must be run again to reflect the changes.

### Sec 3.3
* Code generated from running the `/hash`: `8FC5CFF7`
