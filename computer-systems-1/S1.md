# Computer Systems 1 Lab S1 -- Logbook
## Oct 15, 2025

## Task 1
* Output from `python3 --version`: `Python 3.13.5`
* Output from `python3 pytest.py`: `raspberry`

## Task 2
* When changing the calue of `ontime` to `1` instead of `0.3`, each LED remains lit for a longer amount of time.

## Task 3
Completed code for `switch.py`:
```py
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
from time import sleep

SWITCH = 21
LED = 13

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(LED, GPIO.OUT)
GPIO.setup(SWITCH, GPIO.IN)

try:
    while True:
        sw = GPIO.input(SWITCH)
        if sw:
            GPIO.output(LED, GPIO.HIGH)
        else:
            GPIO.output(LED, GPIO.LOW)

except KeyboardInterrupt:
    GPIO.cleanup()
```

## Task 4
* When covering the LDR with my hand, the value read decreases significantly.
* The "Normal" reading from the thermistor is around 275-277
* After holding for around 20 seconds, i registered a value of 367.
